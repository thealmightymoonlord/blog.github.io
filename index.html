        <p>Today is the day I make this blog. It does'nt look so good for the moment. Hopefully <br> it looks better when your reading this. <br> <br> Now I did'nt do much today. I did some HTML on Khan Academy but did'nt do any <br> any maths. Lately I been really getting into coding. I should probaly add an about me <br> section. I'll do it tommorrow. I'm planning to countinue my precalculus learning, I'm <br> on "Matrices" now if you were wondering. Hopefully I'll make some progress on that <br> tommorrow.</p>
